The assignment assigned asked for some sort of data visualization, I decided to utilize the trends associated with the word 'summer' over the span of 5 years. This is because I wanted to utilisze something seasonal as the trend would keep fluctuating.
I wanted to utilize this because I believe ot would have created an interesting piece. I changed the trend from a 'vertex' to 'ellipses' as I wanted the ellipses to look like suns, as it fit the theme of summer. The fill I chose was (60,100,100), and I had to change it from RGB to HSB to fit the code.
For the background, I drew inpiration from what we have learned in week two, and slightly changed the colors to focus more of blue-tones to imitate a sky. The fill for the background is ((colorOffset + noise(20/ 100, j / 100, 60) * 360)%360, 70, 90). 

Code: 

let summer;
let xoff = 0.0, yoff = 10000; 
let t = 0;
let colorOffset = 0;
  
function preload() {
  summer = loadTable('summer.csv',"csv");
  
}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  print(summer.getRowCount());
  print(summer.getColumnCount());
  frameRate(10);
  colorMode(HSB);
  
}

function draw() {
  background(51,10);
  for(let i = 0; i < width; i+=5) {
    for(let j = 0; j < height; j+=5) {
      
      fill((colorOffset + noise(20/ 100, j / 100, 60) * 360)%360, 70, 90);
      noStroke();
      rect(i, j, 5, 5);
    }
  }
  t = t + 0.003;
  colorOffset += 1;
  stroke(1);
  fill(60,100,100);
  beginShape();
  for(let i=3;i<summer.getRowCount();i++) {

    let newYpos = map(summer.getString(i,1), 0,100,height,0);

    ellipse(i,newYpos,20);
    
  }
  endShape();
  
}
