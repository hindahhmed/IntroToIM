The assignment assigned asked for us to produce a for loop. When producing a for loop, I was inspired by a code done in class. I utilized ellipses and rectangles, and the 'random' feature to generate colors. I utilized a color picker on google [https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&rlz=1C5CHFA_enAE731AE731&oq=color+picker&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512l3j0i512j0i433i512j46i131i433i512j46i10i199i465i512j69i60.2351j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8] in order to generate the colors. I added 3 rectangles and 3 ellipses. 

I changed the frame rate to 10 in order to see the shapes change size at a slower rate, because the frame rate was initially 60. I felt as though 60 was too fast and difficult to keep up with which prompted my change.
