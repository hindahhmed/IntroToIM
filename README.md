A problem I faced was trying to make the font bold. The first time I tried, the hashtag did not work. However, after a few tries it eventually worked and I was able to make the fold bold.

1. A problem I faced was trying to make the font bold. The first time I tried, the hashtag did not work. However, after a few tries it eventually worked and I was able to make the fold bold. 
2. While creating my self portrait, it was very difficult to find the proper skin tone, and adding little details such as the eyes and eyebrows.

### *CODE* ###

function setup() {
 createCanvas(500,600);
  background(20,80,80);
  
  // Rectangle for the neck with a skin tone.
  fill(140,110,90)
  rect(235,140,30,30)
  
  // Circle for the face with a skin tone.
  fill(140,110,90)
  circle(250,95,100);
  
  // Rectangle for the shirt and a pink fill.
  fill(120,50,90)
  rect(205,170,90,125);
  
  fill(140,110,90)
  rect(205,295,90,25)
  
  // Rectangle for the pants with a blue fill.
  fill(50,60,150)
  rect(205,320,40,110)
  
  fill(50,60,150)
  rect(255,320,40,110)
  
  // Rectangle for the shoes with a black fill. 
   fill(0,0,0)
  rect(205,420,40,30)
  
  rect(255,420,40,30)
  
  // Rectangle for the shoulders.
  fill(120,50,90)
  rect(295,170,25,30)
  
  rect(180,170,25,30)
  
  // Rectangle for the arms. 
  
   fill(140,110,90)
  rect(295,200,25,90)
      
  rect(180,200,25,90)
  
  // Circle for the eyes with a brown fill. 
  fill(30,30,0)
  
  circle(265,90,15)
  
  circle(235,90,15)
  
  // Rectangle for the eyebrows with black fill. 
  
  rect(255,70,20,5)
  
   rect(225,70,20,5)
}

For my self portrait, I utilized circles and rectangles to achieve the final product. I utilized a circle for the head and eyes, and rectangles for the neck, body, legs, shoes, and arms.
