* The Plan: *

Once the page is loaded, the user can press enter to start the game. Once the game is started, the user can press the left and right arrow keys to move the ice cream cone and catch as many ice cream scoops if they can. If the user collects 5 ice cream cones, the user wins and a screen displayed reads "you won! click anywhere to restart!". If the user misses 3 scoops, the user loses and a page will be displayed which reads "you lost :( click anywhere to restart!" 

* Technical Difficalties: *

- Solving the bug in the code, that froze my game when the player collected 5 scoops. 
- I could not add a noise when the player lost, as the noise would overlap and be very loud. 
- When the game ends, the player must refresh the page to start again.
