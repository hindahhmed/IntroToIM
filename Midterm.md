# *Production* # 

*The Plan:*

Once the page is loaded, the user can press enter to start the game. Once the game is started, the user can press the left and right arrow keys to move the ice cream cone and catch as many ice cream scoops if they can. If the user collects 5 ice cream cones, the user wins and a screen displayed reads "you won! click anywhere to restart!". If the user misses 3 scoops, the user loses and a page will be displayed which reads "you lost :( click anywhere to restart!" 

*Technical Difficalties:*

- Solving the bug in the code, that froze my game when the player collected 5 scoops. 
- I could not add a noise when the player lost, as the noise would overlap and be very loud. 
- When the game ends, the player must refresh the page to start again. 

*Design Desicions*

- The background of the opening page is baby pink, and there is a picture of an ice cream truck. The ice cream truck was placed in order to fit the theme of the game. 

- The background music, which plays throughout the entire duraring of the game, is a clip of an ice cream truck video I found on YouTube. A converter was utilized in order to turn the clip from a video to an MP3 clip. Link to clip [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPWFlPfuDgo]

- When a player catches a scoop, a licking sound is played. The sound was added in order to make the game more interactive and immerse the player in the game more. Link to video utilized [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaXiqeD0xjM] 

- A score count was added in order to help the player keep track of their progress. 


# *Challenges & Solutions* # 

A callenge I faced while creating and programming the game was the scoops not being captured by the cone. When the scoops would fall, the cone would not catch them and as a result, the player would lose. I solved this issue by changing the distance of the cone from 35 to 45. That way, the cone would catch any scoop close to it and therefore the player would win. Moreover, another challenge I faced was being able to refresh the game when the player has either won or lost. Unfortunatly, I was not able to fix this. The game can only be reloaded if the player refreshes the tab. However, I hope to fix this in the future. 


# *Lessons & Next Steps* # 

One of the biggest lessons I learned throughout the duration of creating my game is persistance. There were many instances in which I felt as though I would not be able to complete my code because of the issues that would arise. However, I persivered and tried, and it was truly a process of trial and error to figure out what went wrong within the code. Something I will do in the future is ask for help when needed, because if I did that I believe my game would have functioned better, however, I am still proud of how it turned out.
